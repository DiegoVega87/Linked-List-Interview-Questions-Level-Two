public class LinkedListAddition {
    /*
    * As part of a startup, we are building a financial application that requires adding two non-negative numbers
    * represented as linked lists. The two linked lists are non-empty and represent the digits of each number in
    * reverse order. We need you to write a function that takes in these two linked lists and returns their sum as
    * another linked list in the same format.
    *
    * Example 1:
    *   l1: 2 -> 4 -> 3
    *   l2: 5 -> 6 -> 4
    *   Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
    *   Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807
    *
    * Example 2:
    *   l1: 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9
    *   l2: 9 -> 9 -> 9
    *   Output: 8 -> 9 -> 9 -> 0 -> 1
    *   Explanation: 9999 + 999 = 10998
