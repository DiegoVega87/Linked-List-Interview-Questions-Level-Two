    * Our startup is designing a fitness tracking app that records users' daily workouts. We need to group all the daily
    * workout data in a linked list. However, we want to reorder the linked list by first listing all the workout data
    * with odd indices and then the workout data with even indices. Can you help us design a function that takes the
    * head of the linked list as input and returns the reordered linked list? The first workout data will be considered
    * odd, the second even, the third odd continuing with the same pattern...
